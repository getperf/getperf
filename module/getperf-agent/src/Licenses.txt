  Decryption code comes from crypt.c by Info-ZIP but has been greatly reduced in terms of
  compatibility with older software. The following is from the original crypt.c.
  Code woven in by Terry Thorsen 1/2003.

  Copyright (c) 1990-2000 Info-ZIP.  All rights reserved.

  See the accompanying file LICENSE, version 2000-Apr-09 or later
  (the contents of which are also included in zip.h) for terms of use.
  If, for some reason, all these files are missing, the Info-ZIP license
  also may be found at:  ftp://ftp.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/license.html

        crypt.c (full version) by Info-ZIP.      Last revised:  [see crypt.h]

  The encryption/decryption parts of this source code (as opposed to the
  non-echoing password parts) were originally written in Europe.  The
  whole source package can be freely distributed, including from the USA.
  (Prior to January 2000, re-export from the US was a violation of US law.)

        This encryption code is a direct transcription of the algorithm from
  Roger Schlafly, described by Phil Katz in the file appnote.txt.  This
  file (appnote.txt) is distributed with the PKZIP program (even in the
  version without encryption capabilities).

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Changes in unzip.c

        2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Addition of cpl_unzGetCurrentFileZStreamPos
  2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Decoration of symbol names unz* -> cpl_unz*
  2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Remove old C style function prototypes
  2007-2008 - Even Rouault - Add unzip support for ZIP64

        Copyright (C) 2007-2008 Even Rouault


        Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Removed cpl_* from symbol names (Even Rouault added them but since this is now moved to a new project (minizip64) I renamed them again).
  Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Fixed problem if uncompressed size was > 4G and compressed size was <4G
                                should only read the compressed/uncompressed size from the Zip64 format if
                                the size from normal header was 0xFFFFFFFF
  Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Applied some bug fixes from paches recived from Gilles Vollant
        Oct-2009 - Mathias Svensson - Applied support to unzip files with compression mathod BZIP2 (bzip2 lib is required)
                                Patch created by Daniel Borca

  Jan-2010 - back to unzip and minizip 1.0 name scheme, with compatibility layer
